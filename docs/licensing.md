# Licensing Information

## License

Agent Arena is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**.

- Full license text: [LICENSE](../LICENSE)
- Attribution notices: [NOTICE](../NOTICE)

## Why Apache 2.0?

We chose Apache 2.0 over MIT for several important reasons:

### 1. Patent Protection
Apache 2.0 includes explicit patent grants, which is crucial for AI/ML projects. This means:
- Contributors grant patent licenses for their contributions
- Users are protected from patent litigation by contributors
- If someone sues claiming patent infringement, their license terminates

This is particularly important for:
- LLM inference technologies
- Agent architectures and algorithms
- Novel tool-use patterns

### 2. Better Legal Clarity
- Clear definitions of "Contribution," "Work," and "Derivative Works"
- Explicit terms for redistribution
- Well-understood by corporate legal departments
- Reduces ambiguity in commercial use

### 3. Trademark Protection
Section 6 protects the "Agent Arena" name and brand:
- Commercial users can't claim endorsement
- Derivative works must distinguish themselves
- Maintains project integrity

### 4. Attribution Requirements
More explicit attribution requirements than MIT:
- Must include copyright notices
- Must include NOTICE file
- Must document changes to modified files
